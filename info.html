      <h3  style="color:#51c946;" >Learning methods to make chickpea cultivation profitable.</h3>
      <h6 style="color:#595f59;">_______________________________________________________</h6>
      <h5 style="color:#07a107;">Background of chickpea cultivation.</h5>
      <p style="color:#959795;" >Chickpea, Cicer arietinum is commonly known as Bengal gram, Gram and Chana is 
        the most important pulse crop in India. It is used for human consumption as well
         as animal feed for cattle. It is mainly consumed for its nutritionally high protein, 
         fibre and potassium content. It can be eaten both whole fried or boiled and salted 
         or more generally in the form of split pulse which is cooked and eaten along with recipes.
          Chickpea is considered to have medicinal effects as it is used for preventing high blood pressure,
           osteoporosis, colorectal cancer and heart problems. In recent times mechanization in chickpea
            is playing an important role especially at the time of harvest.</p>
  
      <h5 style="color:#07a107;">Climatic conditions.</h5>
      <p style="color:#959795;" >Chickpea is a winter season crop but seve cold and frost are injurious to it.
         Frost at the time of flowering results in the failure of flowers to develop seeds or in seed death inside the pods.
          It is generally grown under rainfed conditions, however under irrigated regimes chickpea returns are higher
           Excessive rains soon after sowing or at flowering and fruiting or hail storms at ripening stage can cause heavy 
           crop loss. It is best suited to areas having moderate rainfall of 60-90 cm per annum. The plant of chickpea is
            bushy and grows up to 18 inches in length. It grows best between 70-80 degrees during the day and needs 65-degree
             temperature at night.</p>

       <h5 style="color:#07a107;">Types of chickpea.</h5>
       <p style="color:#959795;" >Commonly two types of chickpea are grown in India viz.,
         desi chana and kabuli chana Desi chana is extensively grown in the country, however the varieties
          are small darker seeds with a rough seed coat. Seeds are lack, green or speckled, which are hulled
           and split to make chana dal. Kabuli' chana varieties are lighter-coloured, larger, and with a softer 
           seed coat.</p>

           <h5 style="color:#07a107;">Soils.</h5>
           <p style="color:#959795;" >Chickpea is grown on wide range of soils in India, but they thrive well
             in sandy loam to clay loam soils. The best type of soils for chickpea is that it is well drained and not 
             too heavy soils. On dry and light soils, plants remain short while on heavy soils having high water retention 
             capacity, the vegetative growth is abundant, light becomes limiting factor and fruiting is eventually retarded.
              The soil chosen for chickpea cultivation should be free from excessive soluble salts and near neutral in reaction
          . Water logging soils and saline soils are not suitable for cultivating especially when soil pH is 8.5 or higher</p>

          <h4 style="color:#07a107;">Chickpea Cultivation.</h4>
          <h5 style="color:#07a107;">Field Preparation to cultivate chickpea with success</h5>
          <p style="color:#959795;" >Chickpea is highly sensitive to soil aeration. It is desirable to go for deep ploughing during
             the monsoon as the same would help in conservation of rainwater in the soil for subsequent use by this crop. To conserve 
             moisture, the soil is cultivated with an animal drawn/tractor-drawn blade harrow attached to a heavy wooden log 
             which also helps in weed control. Shallow cultivation with a country plough is done late in the evening for light
              soils, quite frequently in order to conserve moisture.</p>
            
        <h5 style="color:#07a107;">Sowing time.</h5>
              <p style="color:#959795;">Second fortnight of October is the optimum time for 
           sowing in most of the chickpea growing areas of northern India. In peninsular India,
          the first fortnight of October has been considered as the ideal time for chickpea sowing
           Early sowing of chickpea can result in excessive vegetative growth and poor setting of pods.
        The early sown crop also suffers more from wilt owing to high temperatures during the season.</p>
        
        <h5 style="color:#07a107;">Chickpea seed rate.</h5>
              <p style="color:#959795;">Medium size bold seed type, bold seeded type, and High bold seeded type varieties require 30-35, 45-50 and 60-70 kg seed per ha respectively. Seeds should be treated with recommended pesticides. When chickpea is grown for first time in the field seed treatment with rhizobium should be done at the rate of 200 g of rhizobium (200 g of rhizobium is enough for 8 kg of seed) mixed with 300 ml of 10 % jaggery solution mixed thoroughly and shade dried before sowing them. Always treat the seed with pesticides first before exposing to rhizobium culture is administered</p>

        <h5 style="color:#07a107;">Manure and fertilizer applications.</h5>
              <p style="color:#959795;">Chickpea is a leguminous crop therefore it can meet its own nitrogen requirement (about 75%) through symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the soil, three to four weeks after sowing. It is recommended that 5 tons of farm yard manure per ha can be mixed in the soil during the last plough at the end of field preparation. Previous crop residues can also be incorporated in the soil with a Rotovator. However, soils with low organic matter and poor nitrogen supply may still require 20-25 kg per hectare of nitrogen fertilizer. Besides nitrogen, pulses respond very favourably to the phosphorus application especially through 2 kg of Phosphobacter (biofertilizer) mixed with 200 kg of organic fertilizer in the last plough or while sowing seeds can be applied within crop rows. Over all at an average of 15-20 kg of nitrogen, 20 kg of phosphorus, 8 kg of potash along with 40 kg of sulphur per ha are recommended for chickpea</p>

        <h5 style="color:#07a107;">Weed Control.</h5>
              <p style="color:#959795;">Chickpea being a short stature crop suffers severely with weed infestations. One hand weeding or inter-culture with hand hoe or wheel hoe after 25-30 days and second if needed after 60 days of sowing will take care of weeds. Hand weeding or inter culture with the help of hoe is always better than herbicides because intercultural operations improve aeration in the soil.</p>

       <h5 style="color:#07a107;">Harvesting and Threshing the chickpea.</h5>
              <p style="color:#959795;">Grop should be harvested when leaves start to senesce and start shedding, pods turn yellow, plants are dry, and seed feels hard and rattles within the pod. Chickpea matures in 3 months, after harvest, the plants can be dried in the sun for a few days to ensure that seeds get dried well. Threshing and winnowing can be done using commercially available power threshers Chickpea yields can be up to 16 tonnes per hectare.</p>
